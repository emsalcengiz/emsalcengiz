# Hi there, I'm Emsal!

💁‍♀️✨ I'm an **Associate Data Engineer at Metyis**, building smart, scalable, and cloud-native data pipelines for a global client.

# What I do

🌐 Turning raw data into insights using:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;💙 **Azure** (Functions, Data Lake, Blob Storage)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🐍 **PySpark** for large-scale **batch** and **stream** processing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚙️ **Apache Spark**, **Flink**, **Beam** for distributed computing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;📊 **Power BI** dashboards for data storytelling  

⏱ Working with both:
- ⚡ Real-time data processing (**Spark Structured Streaming**, **Flink**, **Beam**)  
- 🧱 Batch workflows for data aggregation, modeling, and reporting

🧰 Also familiar with:
- 🐳 **Docker** for isolated and portable environments  
- ⛓️ **Apache Airflow** for orchestration and scheduling  
- 📂 **Parquet**, **Delta Lake** for optimized storage  
- 🔁 **REST APIs**, webhooks & automation workflows  
- 🚀 **CI/CD pipelines** for smooth and fast deployments
